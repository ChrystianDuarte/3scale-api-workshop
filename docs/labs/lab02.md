# API Mocking

### Bring your APIs to life

* Duration: 20 mins
* Audience: Developers, Architects, Testers, Quality Engineers

## Overview

> Describe the general idea of the lab and what is the attendant going to learn.

### Why Red Hat?

> Add the keypoints why the attendant will find value using Red Hat products.

### Skipping The Lab

We know sometime we don't have enough time to go over step by step on the labs. So here is a short video where you can see how to mock the API you previously created using Microcks. [link](wip-link)

If you are planning to follow the next lab, here is a [link](wip-link) to the REST mock service running the Location API.

### Environment

**URLs:**

Check with your instruction the *GUID* number of your current workshop environment. Replace the actual number on all the URLs where you find **GUID**. 

Example in case of *GUID* = **1234**: 

```bash
https://master.GUID.openshift.opentlc.com
```

becomes =>

```bash
https://master.1234.openshift.opentlc.com
```

**Credentials:**

Your username is your asigned user number. For example, if you are assigned user number **1**, your username is: 

```bash
user1
```

The password to login is always the same:

```bash
r3dh4t1!
```

## Summary

In this lab you used Microcks to configure a REST mock service for the API definition you created in the previous lab. REST mock services allows you to simulate a REST API service when you are in a prototyping stage of your API program journey. 

Microcks allows you to test a number of various responses for client application requests. When deploying API, micro-services or SOA practices at large scale, Microcks solves the problems of providing and sharing consistent documentation and mocks to the involved teams. It acts as a central repository and server that can be used for browsing but also by your Continuous Integration builds or pipelines.

You can now proceed to [Lab 3](lab03.md)
