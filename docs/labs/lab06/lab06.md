# API Consumption

## Connect Applications and APIs

* Duration: 15 mins
* Audience: API Consumers, Developers, Architects

### Overview

APIs provide the building blocks for applications, but it is applications which deliver functionality to the end users. hence to see APIs in action it helps to see how applications can call APIs to provide new functionality. In this lab you'll be able to create a simple web application which consumes the API you built earlier ojn in the exercises.  

### Why Red Hat?

Applications can be built from many technologies. In this case we use a simple web application, but a wide range of Red Hat and non-Red Hat technologies could be used.

### Skipping The Lab

If you decide to skip the lab you can check how a SSO enabled web applications looks like:

```bash
http://www-international.apps.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com
```

### Environment

**URLs:**

Check with your instruction the *GUID* number of your current workshop environment. Replace the actual number on all the URLs where you find **GUID**. 

Example in case of *GUID* = **1234**: 

```bash
https://master.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com
```

becomes =>

```bash
https://master.1234.openshiftworkshop.com
```

**Credentials:**

Your username is your asigned user number. For example, if you are assigned user number **1**, your username is: 

```bash
user1
```

The password to login is always the same:

```bash
r3dh4t1!
```

## Lab Instructions

### Step 0: Setup the collaboration environment using Git (Gogs)

For this lab we require a collaboration environment based on Git. You can use GitHub, GitLab or other Git provider to finish this lab. If you don't want to use your personal account, the provided lab environment has an user provided for you in Gogs.

Follow this instructions to set up the repository.

1. Open a browser window and navigate to:

    ```bash
    http://gogs.apps.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com/user/login?redirect_to=
    ```

1. Log into Gogs using your designated [user and password](#environment). Click on **Sign In**.

    ![gogs-sign-in](images/consume-01.png "Sign In")

1. In the main page, click in the **+** sign in the right top corner to display the *New* menu. Click the **New Migration** option.

    ![gogs-new](images/consume-02.png "New Migration")

1. Fill in the information of the repository migration with the following values:

    * Clone Address: **https://github.com/hguerrero/3scaleworkshop-wwwpage.git**
    * Owner: **UserX**
    * Repository Name: **www-page**

    ![gogs-migration](images/consume-03.png "New Migration Repository")

1. Click on **Migrate Repository** to fork the GitHub repo into Gogs.

    *You now have a working copy of the International Inc Web page. If you know how to, clone the repository to work locally, or you can continue working using Gogs online editor*.

###Â Step 1: Deploying International Inc Web Page

International Inc web development create a Node.js application for the company home page. They added a map service to locate the offices around the world. In this step you will deploy that application.

1. Open a browser window and navigate to:

    ```bash
    https://master.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com/console
    ```

    *Remember to replace the GUID with your [environment](#environment) value and your user number.*

1. Accept the self-signed certificate if you haven't.

    ![selfsigned-cert](images/00-selfsigned-cert.png "Self-Signed Cert")

1. Log into OpenShift using your designated [user and password](#environment). Click on **Sign In**.

    ![01-login](images/deploy-01.png "OpenShift Login")

1. You are now in OpenShift's main page. Click on your **userX** project in the right side of the screen.

    ![02-user-project](images/deploy-02.png "User Project")

1. From your main project page, click **Browse Catalog**.

    ![03-browse-catalog](images/deploy-03.png "Catalog")

1. Scroll down the page and search for the **Node.js** template. Click on the link.

    ![04-nodejs-template](images/consume-08.png "Template")

1. Click the **Next >** button.

    ![05-template-information](images/consume-09.png "Information")

1. Fill in the configuration information with your API implementation github repo details:

    * Application Name: **www**
    * Git Repository URL: **http://gogs.apps.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com/userX/www-page.git**

    *Remember to replace the GUID with your [environment](#environment) value and your user number*.

    ![06-template-configuration](images/consume-10.png "Configuration")

1. Click **Create**.
  
1. Your service will be provisioned in a moment. Click the **Continue to the project overview** link.

    ![08-template-results](images/consume-11.png "Results")

    _If you clicked the **Close** button, click **Overview** in the left side menu to review the deployment status_.

1. In the overview page, wait until the pod circle stays blue continously. This means the application was successfully deployed and now is ready to listen to requests.

1. Click the external route to open a new tab and connect to *International Inc* new website.

    ![09-application-route](images/consume-12.png "Route")

1. You should now see what the development team created for International Inc. Click **LOCATIONS** to check the locations page.

    ![10-application-page](images/consume-13.png "Webpage")

1. This pages uses the unsecured Location API service. It displays the different International Inc offices around the world.

    ![11-locations-page](images/consume-14.png "Locations Page")

1. In the next step we will update the Locations page to use the 3scale protected API.

### Step 2: Calling a Secured Service with Red Hat Single Sign On

In this step, we will edit the code provided by development to add keycloak. Keycloak is the upstream project powering Red Hat Single Sign On. The Keycloack Javascript Adapter simplifies the required code to interact with the OpenID Connect authentication flows.

1. Go back to your Git repository and navigate to **dev** folder.

    ![15-dev-folder](images/consume-15.png "Dev Folder")

1. Click on the **locations.html** link to open the file.

    ![16-locations-file](images/consume-16.png "Locations File")

1. Change to *edit* mode clicking on the pencil icon on the right side. 

    ![17-locations-edit](images/consume-17.png "Locations Edit")

1. Scroll down the page an look for the following code:

    ```bash
    <!-- Keycloak Adapter Start-->

    <!-- Keycloak Adapter End -->
    ```

1. Import the Javascript Adapter library by pasting between the previous markers the following code:   

    ```bash
    <script src="http://sso-rh-sso.apps.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com/auth/js/keycloak.js"></script>
    ```
    *Remember to replace the GUID with your [environment](#environment) value*.

1. Continue scrolling down until you find the next markers:

    ```bash
    <!-- Keycloak Login Start -->

    <!-- Keycloak Login End -->
    ```

1. Here we will add a **Login** button so users can start the Authentication Flow. It will disapear and be replaced with the map when user is logged in. Paste between the markers the following code:

    ```bash
    <p><a id="loginUrl" href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Sign In to access the Location API Service</a></p>
    ```

1. Continue scrolling down until you find the next markers:

    ```bash
    // Keycloak Config Start

    callService(mymap)

    // Keycloak Config End
    ```

1. Replace the code between the markers with the following snippet:

    ```bash
    var keyOptions = {
        url: 'http://sso-rh-sso.apps.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com/auth',
        realm: 'userX',
        clientId: 'CLIENT_ID'
    };

    var keycloak = Keycloak(keyOptions);
    keycloak.init({ onLoad: 'check-sso' }).success(function (authenticated) {
        if (authenticated) {
            $("<h4>Welcome " + keycloak.idTokenParsed.preferred_username + "</h4> ").insertBefore($('#mapid'));
            callService(mymap, keycloak.token);
            $('#mapid').show();
            $('#loginUrl').hide();
        }
        else {
            $('#mapid').hide();
            $('#loginUrl').show();
        }
    }).error(function (data) {
        alert('Failed to initialize keycloak: ' + data);
    });

    var opts = {
        redirectUri: window.location.origin + "/locations.html"
    };

    var loginUrl = keycloak.createLoginUrl(opts);
    document.getElementById('loginUrl').href = loginUrl;
    ```

    *Remember to replace the GUID with your [environment](#environment) value, your user number and, CLIENT_ID with the one you got in the [API Security Lab](../lab04/lab04.md#step-4-create-a-test-app)*.

1. Continue scrolling down until you find the next markers:

    ```bash
    /* Keycloack Params Start*/

    /* Keycloak Params End */
    ```

1. Paste between the markers the following code:

    ```bash
    , token
    ```

1. Finally the last marker:

    ```bash
    // Keycloak Ajax Start

    url: "http://location-service-international.apps.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com/locations",

    // Keycloak Ajax End
    ```

1. Replace the code between markers with the last snippet:

    ```bash
    // Keycloak Ajax Start
    url: "https://location-userX-api-staging.amp.apps.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com/locations",
    headers: {
         'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
    },
    // Keycloak Ajax End
    ```

    *Remember to replace the GUID with your [environment](#environment) value and your user number*.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page. Update the *Commit Changes* inputs and click **Commit Changes** to save your work.

    ![18-commit-changes](images/consume-18.png "Commit Changes")

1. Because we are using self signed certificates, you will need to accept the certificate for the secured endpoint. Open a new browser tab or window and navigate to:

    ```bash
    https://location-userX-api-staging.amp.apps.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com/locations
    ```

    *Remember to replace the GUID with your [environment](#environment) value and your user number*.

1. Accept the self-signed certificate if you haven't.

    ![selfsigned-cert](images/00-selfsigned-cert.png "Self-Signed Cert")

1. You will see that your call succeded if you see the following text in your browser:

    ```bash
    Authentication parameters missing
    ```

### Step 3: Updating OpenShift Deployment

OpenShift let you automatically redeploy your changes when you setup a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline through the use of webhook. For this lab we will trigger the new build and deployment manually through the OpenShift Console.

1. Go back to your OpenShift web console. Navigate to your project's overview page.

1. Open the kebab menu in the right side of the application information row. Click **Start Build**. 

    ![19-deployment-menu](images/consume-19.png "Deployment Menu")

1. A new build will be triggered. Expand the row by clicking the **Builds** Icon.

    ![20-build-configuraion](images/consume-20.png "Build Configuration")

    *The build process checks out the code from the git repo, runs a source-to-image container image build, and redeploys the container with the new image using a rolling upgrade strategy*.

1. Wait for the build to complete and the rolling upgrade to finish to test your new deployment.

    ![21-build-complete](images/consume-21.png "Build Complete")

1. Refresh the browser tab where you opened the International Inc web page or click the route URL to check out the changes.

    ![22-updated-app](images/consume-22.png "Updated App")

    _You can notice now the **Sign In** button in the page_.

### Step 4: Test the Single Sign On Integration

1. Let's test the integration. Click the **Sign In** button.

1. You are being redirected to Red Hat Single Sign On **Login Page**. Login using the user credentials you created in the [API Security Lab](../lab04/lab04.md#step-2-add-user-to-realm)

    * Username: **apiuser**
    * Password: **apipassword**

    ![23-realm-login](images/consume-23.png "Login Realm")

1. You will be redirected again to the **LOCATIONS** page where now you will be able to see the map with the International Inc Offices.

    ![11-locations-page](images/consume-14.png "Locations Page")

 *Congratulations!* You have successfully used the Keycloak Javascript Adapter to protect International Inc's Locations Service with Single Sign On.

## Steps Beyond

So, you want more? You can explore in detail the documentation on the Javascript Adapter to check what other things can you get from your authenticated user.

## Summary

In total you should now have been able to follow all the steps from designing and API, deploying it's code, issuing keys, connecting OpenID connect and calling it from an application. This gives you a brief overview of the creation and deployment of an API. There are many variations and extensions of these general principles to explore!

This is the last lab of this workshop.
